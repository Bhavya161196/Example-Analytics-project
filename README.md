A simple Python script demonstrating basic functionalities

# Project Title
Youtube Data Analysis

# Short Description
In order to determine how different channel types are distributed among the most popular channels, this study examines a dataset of YouTube channels. The data contains details about country, channel type, views of videos, subscribers, uploads, and more.

# Getting Started
Set up your settings and conduct the analysis according to the instructions below to begin working on this project.

# Prerequisites
Python 3.x
pandas library

# Installing
Install Anaconda Navigator to use Jupyter Notebook or collab 
Ensure the dataset youtube_dataset.csv is in the project directory.
 
# Running the tests
Make a subset of the dataset and test the function with it.
Utilizing the subset, call the calculate_channeltype_distribution function.
Check to see if the distribution that was returned matches the intended output.


# Breakdown of Tests
The script includes a function calculate_channeltype_distribution which:
Takes a DataFrame and the number of top channels to analyze.
Returns the distribution of channel types

# Deployment
Ensure that all necessary software is installed.
The youtube_dataset.csv file should be placed in the project folder.
To create the analysis and output files, run the script.
